<h1>12-Week Strategic Work Plan: Customer-Centric Business & IT Transformation</h1>

<section>
  <h2>Overall Project Division</h2>
  <p>The work is divided into two main periods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Period 1: Mid-September to December</strong> – Business designs customer channels, processes including 02c, supply chain, P2P, business rules, and authority metrics with IT support and advice. IT consolidates platforms into an Application Portfolio to reduce redundancy and identify cost-saving opportunities. A software developer will be engaged to assess resources, budget, and staffing needs to support new business models and architecture. The result will be detailed designs and application enhancements focusing on order fulfillment and data integration for management reports.</li>
    <li><strong>Period 2: Starting January onwards</strong> – Team operates under the new organizational structure, implements app changes and workflows, revamps applications as designed, and continuously monitors progress and results.</li>
  </ul>
